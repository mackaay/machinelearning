# Fill in the ___, build a tree model: tree
#Use rpart() to learn a tree model and assign the result to tree. You should use three arguments:
#The first one is a formula: Survived ~ .. This represents the function you're trying to learn. We're trying to predict the Survived column, given all other columns (writing . is the same as writing Pclass + Sex + Age in this formula).
#The second one is the dataset on which you want to train. Remember, training is done on the train set.
#Finally, you'll have to set method to "class" to tell rpart this is a classification problem.
tree <- rpart(Survived ~ ., train, method = "class")

# Draw the decision tree
fancyRpartPlot(tree)
