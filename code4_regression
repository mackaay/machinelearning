## The kang_nose dataset and nose_width_new are already loaded in your workspace.

# Plot nose length as function of nose width.
plot(kang_nose, xlab = "nose width", ylab = "nose length")

# Fill in the ___, describe the linear relationship between the two variables: lm_kang
lm_kang <- lm(nose_length ~ nose_width, data = kang_nose)

# Print the coefficients of lm_kang
lm_kang$coefficients

# Predict and print the nose length of the escaped kangoroo
predict(lm_kang, nose_width_new)
