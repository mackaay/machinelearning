#For example, cluster 5 from seeds_km_1 completely contains cluster 1 from seeds_km_2 (33 objects). 
#Cluster 4 from seeds_km_1 is split, 18 objects were put in seeds_km_2's fourth cluster and 41 in its fifth cluster. 
#For consistent and decent results, you should set nstart > 1 or determine a prior estimation of your centroids.
